MultiTouchScreen for iPhone


By David Petrie <www.davidpetrie.com>


MultiTouchScreen is an Objective-C++ extension for EAGLView, and is a wrapper around the multitouch functionality of the iPhone and iPod Touch. It was adapted from the "TouchScreen" class in the Oolong Engine <www.oolongengine.com>.

This class is intended for apps that need to synchronize user input and rendering, such as games. It is also useful if you want to convert multitouch input into another form of input, such as mouse or trackball input.

The library is currently used in a game on the iTunes App Store called "Smashed". More detail can be found at <http://smashed.hackdirt.com>
